- 👋 Hi, I’m @bbillips
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack software development and cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    - Hacking, server hardening, documentation, and testing in cybersecurity
    - Coding more proficiently using software components that I lack experience with (e.g., using Next JS 14 in typescript, prisma for ORM, neon/supabase, etc.).
    - Dungeons & Dragons
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that contribute to my growth via the challenge of constantly evolving technology and development.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Don't worry, I'll find you 🔍
